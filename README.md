# NGINX Plus Go Client

This project includes a client library for working with NGINX Plus API.

## About the Client

`client/nginx.go` includes functions and data structures for working with NGINX Plus API as well as some helper
functions.

## Compatibility

This Client works against versions 4 to 9 of the NGINX Plus API. The table below shows the version of NGINX Plus where
the API was first introduced.

| API version | NGINX Plus version |
|-------------|--------------------|
| 4 | R18 |
| 5 | R19 |
| 6 | R20 |
| 7 | R25 |
| 8 | R27 |
| 9 | R30 |

## Using the Client

1. Import `github.com/nginxinc/nginx-plus-go-client/client` into your go project.
2. Use your favorite vendor tool to add this to your `/vendor` directory in your project.

## Testing

### Unit tests

```console
cd client
go test
```

### Integration tests

Prerequisites:

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- golang
- Make
- NGINX Plus license - put `nginx-repo.crt` and `nginx-repo.key` into the `docker` folder.

Run Tests:

```console
make test
```

This will build and run two NGINX Plus containers and create one docker network of type bridge, execute the client tests
against both NGINX Plus APIs, and then clean up. If it fails and you want to clean up (i.e. stop the running containers
and remove the docker network), please use `make clean`
